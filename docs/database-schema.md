# EngX v2 — Database Schema

Tables are defined in `src/lib/db/schema/` using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Supabase).
Each domain has its own module; `src/lib/db/schema/index.ts` re-exports everything.
`src/lib/db/schema.ts` is a thin backward-compatibility re-export — prefer importing from `@/lib/db`.
